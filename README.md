# Hangover Fight Club: 2IB5  
## + Fight Club Pancakes

Small, durable, 3D-printable objects for New Year’s Eve, the morning after, and anyone who understands preparation.

This repository contains two related designs:

- **Hangover Fight Club: 2IB5** — a breakaway capsule for small “kits”
- **Fight Club Pancakes** — a plastic recipe plaque designed to be packed inside

Both are open source. Both are meant to be printed, used, and remixed.

## Hangover Fight Club: 2IB5

A snap-open capsule with a deliberately weakened seam.

### Default concept
- Holds **2 ibuprofen**
- **1 Benadryl**
- **5-HTP**
- Or peas, rice, candy, confetti, or nothing at all

> If you’re strong enough to open it, you’re strong enough for what’s inside.

### Notes
- Breakaway seam is tuned for FDM printing
- Designed to print **12-up** efficiently
- Color swaps encouraged — contents can be encoded by filament
- Scales cleanly (200%+ works well for dry mixes)

⚠️ Not a toy. Small parts. Choking hazard. Keep out of reach of children.

## Fight Club Pancakes

A plastic recipe plaque originally conceived to survive:
- humidity
- grease
- steam
- New York cockroaches

### Printed recipe (dry mix only)

- salt  
- flour  
- sugar  
- baking soda  
- baking powder  
- milk powder  

### Footer incantation (printed)

> **add 1 egg, 1 tbl oil, H₂O ¼ c q.s.**

Designed to be:
- printed at **200%**
- wrapped in parchment paper
- packed inside Hangover Fight Club capsules

---

## Printing Notes

- PLA works fine; PETG is great
- Pause prints for:
  - insert
  - color swap
- Multiple pauses close together → set it, sleep, wake up to a finished batch
- 12-up on an AnkerMake M5C: ~4h19m (yes, really)

All designs are parametric OpenSCAD and easy to modify.

## Lineage & Attribution

**Hangover Fight Club: 2IB5** is a remix derived from:

- **Fight Club Soap** by **Brassee**  
  https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4656165

The original soap STL provided the conceptual seed and overall form factor.

This remix was rebuilt in OpenSCAD with:
- new geometry
- a parametric breakaway seam
- revised proportions
- non-soap intent (kits, inserts, batching, dry goods)

All changes are intentional. Credit where credit is due.

Inspiration and encouragement from CarlyD and cinnamon flower.

## Suomi (Sisu)

**Sinivalkoinen suomalaisille — sisua ja turnauskestävyyttä.**

Tämä ei ole lelu.  
Tämä ei ole kertakäyttöinen.  

Suunniteltu kestämään:
- kosteutta  
- kuumuutta  
- höyryä  
- aikaa  

Tulosta. Käytä. Riko tarvittaessa.  
Jos saat sen auki, olet valmis siihen, mitä sisällä on.
